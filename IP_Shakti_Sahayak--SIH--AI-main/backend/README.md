# IP-SAKTI Sahayak — FastAPI Backend

This backend exposes the existing AI/RAG pipeline to the frontend without
reimplementing retrieval or generation logic.

## Backend structure

- `app/main.py` — FastAPI application, CORS, liveness endpoint, starts the
  auto-update scheduler when `UPDATES_SCHEDULER_ENABLED=true`
- `app/api/routes.py` — `/query`, `/corpus`
- `app/api/updates_routes.py` — `/updates/*`, the auto-update review gate
- `app/api/patent_prep_routes.py` — `/patent-cases/*`, patent prep and tracking
- `app/schemas.py` — Pydantic request/response contracts
- `app/services/ai_service.py` — adapter between FastAPI and the existing AI/RAG pipeline
- `app/services/updates_service.py` — adapter between FastAPI and `ai/updates`
- `app/services/patent_prep_service.py` — adapter between FastAPI and `ai/patent_prep`
- `tests/test_api.py` — backend API tests

## API endpoints

### `GET /health`

Liveness check. Returns HTTP 200 when the API process is running.

### `GET /api/v1/corpus`

Reports the configured Chroma collection and number of indexed chunks.

### `POST /api/v1/query`

Runs the existing retrieval → confidence/abstention → generation pipeline,
an ABS-compliance screening off the same classification (see
`ai/compliance`), and logs the query to the DPDP-aligned audit trail (see
`ai/audit.py`).

Example request:

```json
{
  "query": "Can a classical Ayurvedic formulation be patented in India?",
  "classification": {
    "formulation_type": "classical",
    "source_organism": "plant",
    "jurisdiction": "india"
  },
  "top_k": 5,
  "compliance_facts": {
    "applicant_category": "indian_individual",
    "resource_origin": "india"
  },
  "consent_licensed_acts": [],
  "language": null
}
```

`consent_licensed_acts` names any `access: licensed` acts (see
`ai/corpus.yaml`'s header) the requester consents to being answered from.
Retrieval matching a licensed act without consent for that exact act name
has its citation withheld — `licensed_sources_withheld` in the response
says which. Every document currently in the corpus is public, so this is
normally an empty list on both sides.

`language` is an explicit source-language override (e.g. `"hi"`, `"ta"`);
omit it to auto-detect from the query text (see `ai/translation.py` — a
Unicode-script heuristic, not a language-ID model, so pass this when the
caller actually knows the language). The query is translated to English
before retrieval (`ai/embedder.py`'s default model is English-only) and
the answer translates back; citations and `act_name` are never
translated. Without `BHASHINI_API_KEY`/`BHASHINI_USER_ID` configured,
text passes through untranslated and the response's `translated` field
is `false` — the answer is still correct, just not delivered in the
requester's language.

The response also carries `audit_id`, the id of the row this query wrote
to the audit log, `compliance`, the ABS obligation report (`null` when
neither a classification nor compliance facts were supplied), `language`
(the language `answer_text`/`disclaimer` are in), and `translated`.

### Auto-update pipeline (`/api/v1/updates/*`)

Wraps `ai/updates` (see its own README for the tier logic). Off by
default — set `UPDATES_SCHEDULER_ENABLED=true` to have the process poll
`ai/updates/sources.yaml` on a schedule (`UPDATES_INTERVAL_MINUTES`,
default 60), and `UPDATES_AUTO_INGEST=true` to let AUTO_PUBLISH /
PUBLISH_THEN_AUDIT tiers ingest immediately rather than sit in the queue
for an operator to publish explicitly.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /updates/pending` | MANDATORY_REVIEW items awaiting approve/reject |
| `GET /updates/queued` | Cleared but not yet ingested (the backlog when `UPDATES_AUTO_INGEST=false`) |
| `GET /updates/needs-audit` | Already-published PUBLISH_THEN_AUDIT items awaiting sign-off |
| `GET /updates/history?limit=50` | Decided/published/failed entries |
| `POST /updates/check-now` | Run one watch cycle synchronously — `{"auto_ingest": true\|false\|null}` |
| `POST /updates/{id}/approve` | `{"decided_by": "...", "notes": "..."}` |
| `POST /updates/{id}/reject` | Same body shape |
| `POST /updates/{id}/clear-audit` | Sign off a `needs-audit` entry |
| `POST /updates/{id}/publish` | Run the real ingestion pipeline for an `approved`/`queued_for_ingest` entry |

`decided_by` is free text, not checked against a login session — see
`ai/updates/README.md`'s "what's a skeleton" section before exposing
these beyond a trusted operator.

### Patent preparation and tracking (`/api/v1/patent-cases/*`)

Wraps `ai/patent_prep` (see its own README) — a module separate from the
RAG core: intake, an ABS/prior-art precheck, draft form content, and
deadline tracking for one case, ending in a handoff package for a
registered patent agent.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /patent-cases` | Create a case from intake fields (see `CaseIntakeRequest`) |
| `GET /patent-cases?status=...` | List cases, optionally filtered |
| `GET /patent-cases/{id}` | Full case record |
| `GET /patent-cases/{id}/events` | Case event history |
| `PUT /patent-cases/{id}/intake` | Replace the intake (facts arrive over several conversations) |
| `POST /patent-cases/{id}/precheck` | Run the ABS/prior-art screening (`ai.compliance.assess()`) |
| `POST /patent-cases/{id}/draft-forms` | Draft Form 1 / Form 3 (and Form 27, once granted) |
| `GET /patent-cases/{id}/deadlines` | Computed deadlines — some `review_status: draft`, confirm before relying on them |
| `POST /patent-cases/{id}/handoff` | Bundle everything and record the handoff to an agent |
| `POST /patent-cases/{id}/status` | Set any status, including ones this module cannot observe itself (`filed`, `granted`, ...) |

Draft form content is a preparation aid, not a filed copy — see
`ai/patent_prep/README.md`'s "Draft forms are not filled official forms"
section.

## Setup

From the repository root:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows PowerShell
.venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1

pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and configure the values you
need. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is required only for live answer generation; retrieval
and abstention are handled before the LLM call.

The backend uses `data/chroma` by default. That directory must contain the
indexed corpus generated by the existing ingestion pipeline.

## Build the corpus

Place the approved legal/reference PDFs in a local input directory and run the
existing ingestion CLI from the repository root, for example:

```bash
python -m ai.cli data/pdfs --manifest ai/corpus.yaml --chroma-path data/chroma --sqlite-path data/registry.sqlite3
```

Use `--dry-run` first when validating a new corpus. Do not commit private API
keys or restricted source documents to the repository.

## Run the API

Recommended command:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --app-dir backend
```

The `app` package also uses relative imports, so importing it through
`backend.app.main` works when the repository root is on `PYTHONPATH`.

OpenAPI documentation:

- `/docs`
- `/redoc`

## Tests

Run all project tests:

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

The backend tests mock the AI service where appropriate, so they do not require
an API key or a populated production corpus.
